# ML_AirCanada
The purpose of this project is to create a neural network to predict the future price of stocks. In this project, we have focused on one specific Canadian-based airline company, Air Canada, however, this can be easily modified to provide predictions for any other company listed on the New York or Toronto stock exchange.
